This project involves the analysis and modeling of crop data, focusing on data preparation, exploration, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

**Project Overview**
**Task 1: Data Loading & Preparation**
Three crop data files were provided for analysis. The following steps were performed:

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured data integrity using the pandas library in JupyterLab.
Data Merging: Combined the three cleaned files into a single comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

**Task 2: Data Exploration**
Explored the cleaned dataset to identify key metrics and insights, as documented in task2.ipynb. This exploration helped in understanding the data distribution and identifying patterns relevant to the project.

**Task 3: Train & Test Data Preparation**
Prepared the dataset for machine learning by splitting it into training and testing sets. This step ensured that the models could be properly trained and evaluated.

**Task 4: Modeling & Assessment**
Developed and tested two machine learning models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
After evaluating both models using appropriate metrics, the KNN model was determined to be the best performer with an accuracy of 83%.

**Conclusion:**
This project successfully demonstrates the process of data preparation, exploration, and predictive modeling in the context of crop data. The KNN model provided the best results, highlighting its effectiveness in this scenario.
